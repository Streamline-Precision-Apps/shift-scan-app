  }
}
```

### 2. Add iOS Info.plist Entries (2 minutes)

**File:** `ios/App/App/Info.plist`

2. Or manually: Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace`
3. Select "App" ‚Üí "Info"
4. Add these keys with + button

**Keys to add:**
```xml

<string>This app needs access to your photo library to select profile images</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
